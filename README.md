As the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare increases, from detecting tumours to assisting handicapped patients, there has been breakthrough technologies in the machine learning field that levitate the power of artificial intelligence to improve the health of patients and aid healthcare specialists. Especially in the study of neuroscience where the amount and complexity of the data collected has been increasing, using advanced machine learning techniques have become imperative for analysing the data and providing outcomes to assist patients to improve their lives from suffering neurological disorders. The aim of this project is to build different machine learning models that can classify the brain activity of the brain by learning to understand neurological data (EEG data) that depicts different functions of humans.
